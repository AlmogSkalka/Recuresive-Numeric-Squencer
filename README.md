# Recursive Digit “Summer”

Console App 1:
Recursive Digit “Summer”
Write a function to find the sum of all digits in a given arbitrary number. 
✅Please use recursion for the solution 👍
🚫No conversion to strings, loops or other old fashioned stuff 👎
Example:
input: 2347623
output: 27 (=2+3+4+7+6+2+3)


# Recursive Numeric “Sequencer”
Console App 2:
You are given a sequence of numbers which are read from a stream (for example, as user input through the keyboard). 
You cannot store the whole sequence in memory so you should process each number only once without referring to the previous numbers in the sequence. 
Write a function that counts the elements of the sequence that equal the maximum element in the whole sequence. 
Notes:
✅The solution must use recursion - a solution with loops won’t count
The last element of the sequence is always zero so use ‘0’ as a marker to stop processing the sequence
The sequence has at least one element
The algorithm must print only once, after 0 has been received and the processing of the stream is finished
